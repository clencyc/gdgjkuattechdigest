3. **Great Community**: Lots of resources and support
4. **Job Opportunities**: High demand in the market

## Your First Python Program

```python
print("Hello, GDG JKUAT!")

# Variables and data types
name = "Student"
age = 20
is_learning = True

print(f"Hi {name}, you are {age} years old!")
```

## Next Steps

1. Install Python from python.org
2. Try our interactive coding challenges
3. Join our Python study group every Thursday!

Happy coding! üéâ
